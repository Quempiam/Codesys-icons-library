>This Codesys library contains selected icons from Pawe≈Ç 'codecalm' Kuna's "Tabler Icons" project on github 
https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons.git


---

Library contains two sets of icons: Filled (black) and Filled_white (white ...suprisingly)
Icons filenames are the same in both sets, so there is possibility to switch between colors 
by changing path.

TODO: I wasn't able to find a way to change icon fill color in codesys object properties
so this is why I made white set. Files are xml editable and have "fill=" property.
Maybe there is a way to make Codesys change it.
